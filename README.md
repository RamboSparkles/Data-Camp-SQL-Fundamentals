# Data-Camp-SQL-Fundamentals

I am currently completing the SQL Fundamentals course on Data Camp.

As of today 20200305, I have been hand writing notes down in a notebook but that is taking more time than necessary.

I would still like to take notes but I would like to do it digitally.  I figured that putting them onto GitHub may be useful to other users.  I also like the fact that GitHub allows you to use a formatting type more similar to coding.

I am unsure which courses I will do after SQL but Python is high on the list, especially since I already have some experience using it.
